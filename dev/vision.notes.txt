---Shape Arena vision---
* A "brutal" game where you lose all progress on death
* ship shooter style gameplay
* incentive to kill creeps before pvping 

----- Gameplay loop -----
spawn at graveyard [Middle? top corner?] as a triangle
kill other ships [Players or NPCs] to gain $$$$$$
spend $$$$$ on upgrades at a shop you fly to [the "Garage"] 

---- SHOP ---- 
bullet upgrades make your bullets increase size, speed, or distance 
ship upgrades make your ship increase speed, max health, regen rate 





The game code itself needs to become more robust, this makes me a little concerend about no typescript


I don't like the current client state / server state seperation. 
Lets try to make this more reasonably by having a single state, 
and use an extraction and emit function to filter the data the client needs
